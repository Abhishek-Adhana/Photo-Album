# Photo Album Web Application

This is a simple photo album web application built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. The application displays images in a layout of one main image and two smaller images per page, with basic pagination for navigation through multiple pages of images.


# Folder Structure

# How to use locally (must installed php in the system)

- A local server that supports PHP (like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP).
- Move the photo-album directory into the htdocs folder (or the equivalent folder for your local server).
- Place your sample images in the images/ directory. Ensure that the images you add are in a supported format (like JPEG, PNG).
